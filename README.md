# 8-Bit Custom CPU on Tang Nano 9K

This project implements a complete 8-bit CPU from scratch on the Tang Nano 9K FPGA board. All modules — including the ALU, register file, instruction decoder, control unit, and I/O interface — were built in Verilog using finite state machines (FSMs), with a fully custom-designed instruction set architecture (ISA).

## Features

- **Custom Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**
  - Supports MOV, arithmetic/logical operations, jumps, and I/O instructions.
  - Simple 8-bit instruction format for clarity and compactness.

- **Modular Verilog Design**
  - ALU with support for ADD, SUB, INC, DEC, AND, OR, XOR
  - Register file with 4 general-purpose registers (A, B, C, D)
  - Instruction decoder and control unit implemented using FSMs
  - Program counter, RAM access, and memory-mapped LCD output
  - Flash reader module to use a TF-card as ROM

- **Memory-Mapped LCD Output**
  - Sends character data to an HD44780-compatible LCD screen
  - Supports direct printing from memory or registers

- **Custom Compiler**
  - Translates human-readable assembly to machine code matching the ISA
  - Automates binary generation for program ROM initialization

## Instruction Set Summary

| Instruction       | Description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `MOV R1, R2`       | Move value from register R2 to R1                |
| `MOV R, IMM`       | Move immediate value to register R               |
| `MOV [ADDR], R`    | Store register value into memory                 |
| `MOV R, [ADDR]`    | Load memory value into register                  |
| `ADD R1, R2`       | Add R2 to R1                                     |
| `SUB R1, R2`       | Subtract R2 from R1                              |
| `AND/OR/XOR R1, R2`| Logical operations between registers             |
| `JMP / JZ / JNZ / JOV` | Control flow with conditional jumps         |
| `PRNT [ADDR]`      | Print character to LCD at cursor address in A   |
| `NOP`              | No operation                                     |
| `HLT`              | Halt CPU execution                               |

## Hardware Requirements

The entire setup requires:
- Tang Nano 9k FPGA board
- HD44780-compatible LCD
- A 1MB flash storage microsd card


## Learning Outcomes
- Understood the fetch-decode-retrieve-execute pipeline to run a CPU.
- Designed how to build an ISA, Assembler and a decoder
